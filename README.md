# OVERVIEW

The Portable C Library (PCL) API Documentation. This branch is solely used to serve Doxygen generated documentation via GitHub Pages. The Doxyfile and other doxygen related files are in the master branch. Whenever this repo is updated, all files within the "docs" folder are first removed, then doxygen is ran to repopulate "docs" and finally the changes are pushed. This will delete files that are no longer used by the most recent run of doxygen. Commit message are pretty much worthless on this branch.
